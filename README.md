Athan Home Requires Golang to build the binary, and Apache or other WebServer + PHP + SQL
to fully function

### Setting up the binary
Setup for the most part is pretty simple given you have some basic knowledge of using linux or have atleasted used a raspberry.
For running this I recommend using a raspberry pi Zero W, its small and very usfull it will allow you to enjoy the full functionality of this neat program

Instaling Golang
We first must install GoLang (this isnt required when running the actuall binary but will be required when trying to build the binrary)

Please Follow this tutorial:
