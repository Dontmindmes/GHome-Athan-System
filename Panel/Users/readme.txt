Place both the Main.go file and Config.json file here
and build the main.go using
"go build"
and run 
"sudo chmod 777 config.json"

A new file called Users should be created, run 
"sudo cp Users Athan"

then use screen to execute ./Athan and make sure before you exit you
hold "Ctrl + A + D" at the same time, if done correctly it should say detacted
and athan home should now be working in the background
